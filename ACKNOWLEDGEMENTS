Thank you to the open source community surrounding D-STAR, which has
helped me immensely in understanding the D-STAR packet format.

Thank you to the JARL for the publication and development of the D-STAR
specification, which has been of great use to understand DV fast data,
use of the data fields, D-PRS encoding, and the CRC encoding algorithm
used.

Thank you to to the APRS working group and Ian Wade, G3NRW for producing
the APRS specification 1.0 PDF.

Thank you to Thomas Early, N7TAE, and the QnetGateway software which
provided a wonderful model for the structure of D-STAR gateway software.

Thank you to Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX, for the IRCDDBgateway software.

Thank you to IRCDDB and its creators for a really neat solution to the
D-STAR callsign routing problem.
